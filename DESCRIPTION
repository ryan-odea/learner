Description: Implements transfer learning methods for low-rank matrix 
    estimation. These methods leverage similarity in the latent row and column 
    spaces between the source and target populations to improve estimation in 
    the target population. The methods include the LatEnt spAce-based tRaNsfer 
    lEaRning (LEARNER) method and the direct projection LEARNER (D-LEARNER) 
    method described by McGrath et al. (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.20605>.
