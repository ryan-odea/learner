Description: Implements methods to estimate a low rank matrix in an 
    underrepresented target population from multi-source data. These methods 
    leverage similarity in the latent row and column spaces between the source 
    and target populations to improve estimation in the target population. 
    The methods include the LatEnt spAce-based tRaNsfer lEaRning (LEARNER) 
    method and the direct projection LEARNER (D-LEARNER) method described
    by McGrath et al. (in preparation).
